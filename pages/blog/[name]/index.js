                                        Almost instantly the whole truth of the transaction seemed to
                                        rush upon her mind, and her wrath was inconceivably violent. She
                                        asked me a thousand questions in a breath; but, fortunately, was
                                        too vehement to attend to my embarrassment, which must otherwise
                                        have betrayed my knowledge of the deceit. Revenge was her first
                                        wish; and she vowed she would go the next morning to Justice
                                        Fielding, and inquire what punishment she might lawfully inflict
                                        upon the Captain for his assault.

                                        I believe we were an hour at Bishopsgate Street before poor
                                        Madame Duval could allow any thing to be mentioned but her own
                                        story; at any length, however, Mr. Branghton told her, that M.
                                        Du Bois, and all his own family, were waiting for her at his
                                        house. A hackney-coach was then called, and we proceeded to Snow
                                        Hill.

                                        Mr. Branghton's house is small and inconvenient; though his
                                        shop, which takes in all the ground floor, is large and
                                        commodious. I believe I told you before, that he is a
                                        silver-smith.

                                        would not have been in this room to see her: I'm quite ashamed
